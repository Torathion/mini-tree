`mini-tree` is a tiny, flexible, zero-dependency [Tree data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(abstract_data_type)) designed to be used for any purpose that requires data either ordered in a hierarchical structure or are in relation to each other. With an easy to use API, it's designed for those problems suited for managing hierarchical data without asking the
question "What kind of tree fits the best?".

```powershell
    pnpm i mini-tree
```

## Why should I use a tree data structure?

Even if you don't know whether your data in question is in any kind of relation to each other, a tree data structure is designed to reduce the number of checks and branches by organizing your data. It's designed to efficiently search the data you need based on previously searched data, optimizing a linear or even binary search.
As an example we use the JS linter [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/). `eslint` is configured to lint our `src` folder using `eslint src` and for that, it tries to find this folder. Luckily, a modern OS structures its folders in a tree data structure, so instead of the 10.000+ folders a modern OS comes with, `eslint` only needs to check the current
working directory it's been called from and only has to check 5 or 6 folders as these are the direct child folders of the parent current working directory. And due to every folder being ordered hierarchically, `eslint` can easily detect what files belong to the `src` folder instead of blindly linting every file it finds. That is the power of a tree data structure.

**TL;DR**: It's to vastly optimize linear searching when searching something or to access scoped data relating to a common parent.

## Usage

`mini-tree` relies on callbacks to achieve it's universal-purpose design. And those callbacks are structured differently:

- `TreeComparator<T>` compares a `TreeNode<T>` with a specific value to usually check for further traversal to its child nodes. In other cases, namely if a value equals a node, it will either remove it (in `tree.remove`) or cancel a process (in `tree.add`).
- `Traverser<T>` takes only a node to either iterate through it (in `tree.traverseAsync`) or validate it for further traversal to its child nodes.
- `AsyncTraverser<T>` is an asynchronous version of `Traverser` only used in `tree.traverseAsync`

```typescript

import Tree, { type TreeNode, type TreeComparator, type Traverser } from 'mini-tree'


// Comparator that traverses down the hierarchy if the target value is larger than a node value
const comp: TreeComparator<number> = (node: TreeNode<number>, value: number) => value > node.value
// Edge case comparator to check if a tree already contains the value or a new node has to be added
const eq: TreeComparator<number> = (node: TreeNode<number>, value: number) => value === node.value

// Create a new tree with comp and eq as its default comparators and a root node value of 0.
// The root value dictates the generic type of the tree. This should match the generic type of comp and eq
const tree = new Tree(0, comp, eq)

// Add values
tree.add(5)
tree.add(3)
tree.add(7)

// Add same values (won't do anything)
tree.add(5)

// Add values with custom comparators
tree.add(9, (n, v) => n.value > v, (n, v) => n.value === 5)

// Start from a specific sub node
tree.add(13, comp, eq, tree.node(3))

// Remove node with a specific value
tree.remove((n) => n.value === 5)

// Traverse through all nodes using BFS
for (const node of tree) {
    console.log(node.value)
}

// Find nodes
if (tree.has(7)) // Do cool stuff
```
